# My Terminal Setup

## Introduction

This is my terminal setup.  It consists of a a zshrc and associated files.
It also includes configuration files for vim, emacs, tmux and a setup
script.  It also contains setup scripts to install programs I use on MacOS
and Ubuntu... These are under development and should be merged in to one 
super setup script at some point.
